        <p>Split|it is a web app that I helped create during my time studying at Le Wagon in Tokyo. My fellow group members and I coded the entire project over a period of 2 weeks in June 2021, and pitched at Le Wagon's Pitch Night on Friday, June 11 to a crowd of ~80 on Zoom.</p>
        <div class="project-image-vertical">

        </div>
        <p>We began with an almost day-long brainstorm session, where we figured out the core user journey. We decided that the app was aimed at people in relationships who have separate bank accounts and need to split shared expenses evenly.</p>

        <p>The first week, we hunkered down and worked really hard to have a working web app for our pitch on the first Friday. Our hard work paid off, and we had an app that could collect and store 'splits', or groups of expenses that share a common category, or theme, and divide them evenly between two people.</p>

        <p>We pitched on Friday to our classmates and teachers, and received some praise and a lot of critiques.</p>

        </div>

        <p>We came back the following Monday with a renewed vigor to make this web app look and perform great. Initially, our idea was to use OCR to scan a receipt directly into a split, but the API we used didn't perform as we'd hoped. We decided to scrap that part of the project and just rely on manual entry of a receipt, but after some discussions with the teachers, we were convinced to give it a try anyway.</p>

        <p>After a lot of hard work, we had a web app where you could:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: initial; padding-left: 16px;">
          <li class="split-it-list">log in</li>
          <li class="split-it-list">create a group</li>
          <li class="split-it-list">invite your friends/family via qr code</li>
          <li class="split-it-list">create splits</li>
          <li class="split-it-list">track expenses via adding receipts or bills to the split</li>
          <li class="split-it-list">keep a running total of the amount of the split</li>
          <li class="split-it-list">settle the split when finished</li>
          <li class="split-it-list">and let the app guide you, telling you who to pay or collect money from</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="project-image-vertical">
          <img src="images/split-it-settle.PNG" style="height: 450px; border: 10px solid #333333;">
        </div>

        <p>In my opinion, one of the most interesting features we added was settling a split involving more than two people. This is done by using a "banker", like in Monopoly. One person will collect from those who owe money and pay out to those who are owed money. It keeps things relatively simple, and I think it was an elegant solution, given that we only had 2 weeks to build the app.</p>

        <p>After two weeks of hard work and late nights, we made something we are all proud of. We received lots of great feedback and praise on Pitch Night. My main contribution to this project was on the front-end, but I did a little work on some back-end features as well.</p>

        <p>I invite you to try the app yourself, using the link to the left!</p>
