        <p>Chef_Space is an AirBnb clone website that I helped create during my time studying at Le Wagon in Tokyo. My fellow group members and I coded the entire project over a period of 5 days in May 2021.</p>

        <p>We began the project with a lengthy brainstorm session, where we decided on the theme of the project and what we wanted to do. I had the idea of a website where chefs who don't have a restaurant of their own could find a place to rent over the weekend. Those who have a restaurant could rent out their place to make some extra money. I got the idea from seeing the popup restaurant culture that exists in Japan.</p>

        <p>Over the next few days, we had many more meetings to refine our style and add features to the website. One area we struggled with was getting the map to work as a background. This proved to be an ongoing struggle, but eventually we got it to work.</p>

        <p>In the end, we made something we are all proud of. We received great feedback and praise from our instructors and fellow students. Although I had my hand in everything, my main contributions to the site were the logo, idea, and landing page. </p>
